# Masters-DMRG
Python code implementing  Density Matrix Renormalisation Group techniques (DMRG). 

Density Matrix Renormalization Group has become an essential computational tool
over the years to study condensed matter system in one dimension. Here we give a
concrete review of the method and look at its applications in determining ground state
properties of Transverse Ising Model and Heisenberg Model. We will also look for
the signature of quantum phase transition with the help of entanglement entropy and
various other observables defined on the system.
